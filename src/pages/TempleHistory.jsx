          Ancient era was the witness when religious practices and spiritual principles flourished and temples became the world’s storehouse of Knowledge & Culture. Temples being the primary place of worship, are the sacred mansions of ultimate Grace and Happiness.
          <br /><br />
          Sri Venkataramana Temple, Carstreet, Mangalore is one such temple where devotees from all corners galore in large numbers to obtain the grace of Lord Veera Venkatesha Swamy. Ever since its establishment, it is one of the prominent temples belonging to the Gowd Saraswat Brahmin (G.S.B) community.
          The annual Car Festival is celebrated from Magha Shudda Tadige to Ashtami, is the main event which attracts thousands of devotees from all around. The temple follows Madhwa Vaishnava tradition professed by Sri Madhwacharya (Srimad Ananda Tirtha) wherein Lord Vishnu is regarded as supreme Brahman and Lord of the Universe. Lord Venkataramana one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu is being worshipped as the presiding deity in the temple.
          The earliest history of the temple can be traced back to the mid-17th century when the idol of Sri Moola Venkataramana Devaru was installed in the shrine. Sources also throw light that, the bronze idols of Sri Veera Vittala and Sri Gopalakrishna was consecrated in the temple by one Sri Sowkar Mhal Pai in the year 1736 A.D. During this period the temple consisted of only the Garba Griha (Sanctum Sanctorum). But the significant landmark in the history of the temple dates back to 1804 A.D., when the main idol of Lord Veera Venkatesha Swamy (Patta Devaru) was consecrated. This indeed, was the event the devotees of temple all along the generations would relish in their hearts forever! There are two similar stories pertaining to the obtaining of the main idol.
          According to one source, a Bairagi (an ascetic/recluse) visited Mangalore in the year 1804. He sought refuge in a temporary shelter in carstreet and worshipped the charming image of Lord Veera Venkatesha. Fascinated by the beauty of the Idol, crowds started gathering in big numbers to witness the daily puja of the idol and in order to avoid the flow of the crowd, he moved to lower carstreet. But the people of the locality most of whom being the members of G.S.B community were staunch on procuring the idol for their temple, approached the prominent and respected family of Sowkar Thimmappa Pai and succeeded in their request in procuring the idol
          The second story, the widely accepted one, follows that a Bairagi (an ascetic/recluse) visiting Mangalore in 1804 A.D, had with him the idol of Lord Veera Venkatesha, covered with a cloth in a sack. He kept the sack as a collateral for a certain sum of money, in Sowkar Thimmappa Pai’s shop with a stipulation that in case the Bairagi failed in returning the amount lent, Sowkar was free to use the contents of the sack according to his free will. Unaware of the contents of the sack, he kept the same in the storey of his shop. One day it happened that, fumes started emanating from the storey. The watchman under the mistaken impression that the shop had caught fire, rushed to Sowkar’s house and intimated him about the incident. The Sowkar and his men wasted no time in reaching the shop. There they were astonished to see that there was no fire nor any loss incurred, but only fumes were effusing from the sack. As he opened the sack he was enthralled to behold the splendid and magnificent idol of Lord Veera Venkatesha Swamy. He carried the idol and kept it in his family temple (Opp: Sri Gokarna Math, Carstreet) and requested his fellow men to search for the Bairagi. The search however went in vain.
          It was unanimously agreed by Sowkar’s family and nobles of the community that the idol would be displayed to H.H. Shrimad Vibhudhendra Thirtha Swamiji of Sri Kashi Math Samsthan who were camping at Manjeshwar. Swamiji being an ardent saint were very much pleased at sight of the idol. They affirmed that the idol is a miraculous one and suggested that the idol should be consecrated and worshipped in the community temple, where Sri Veera Vittala was the presiding deity, in the better interests of G.S.B people. Their request was wholeheartedly accepted and subsequently on Jyeshta Shuddha Trayodashi of Rakatakshi Samvatsara the idol of Lord Veera Venkatesha Swamy was consecrated under the directions and guidance of Swamiji. Four learned Purohits conducted the proceedings for a period of three days.
          In 1816, the temple became renowned as Kodial Sri Venkataramana Temple. Sri Ranga Bhat was the Paryaya Archak (chief priest) and Sri Vittala Acharya was the Purana Vachak. The Garbha Griha (Sanctorum Sanctum) consists of idols of Sri Veera Venkatesha Swamy, Sri Veera Vittala Devaru, Utsava Sri Srinivasa Devaru, Sri Moola Venkataramana Devaru, Sri Gopalakrishna Devaru, Sri Hayagriva Devaru and Sri Naga Devaru.
          The shrines of Sri Mukhyaprana Devaru & Sri Garuda Devaru were established during the same time. The Car Festival of the year 1821 A.D was graced by the presence of H.H. Shrimad Sumathindra Thirtha Swamiji of Sri Kashi Math Samsthan, patta shisya of H.H. Shrimad Vibhudhendra Thirtha Swamiji. In 1878 A.D Navaratna crown with Basinga was offered to Sri Veera Venkatesha Swamy and Golden Crown to Utsava Deity Sri Srinivasa.
          The Silver Lalkhi was first taken for procession in 1888. The Idols of Sri Lakshmi Devi & Sri Ganapathi Devaru was installed in the year 1896 and 1898 respectively. The construction of Sanna Ratha commenced in1909. The Silver Clad Dhwajasthambha was erected in the year 1966. The Diamond Crown was offered to The Lord in the year 1977. It was in the year 1999 the devotees were blessed to witness Sri Veera Venkatesh adorned in Golden Palanquin.
          In 2011, the Jeernodhara process was initiated, and on 6 May 2011 the Nidhi Kalasha Staphana and foundation stone were laid by the Ubhaya Guruvaryas of Sri Kashi Math Samsthan. On 16 January 2012, the Punar Prathistha(Re-installation) of the deities was established in the holy presence of the Ubhaya Guruvaryas. HH Sudhindra Tirtha Swami and their Patta Sishya Srimad Samyamindra Tirtha also blessed the Pente with an opportunity to organize Parihara and Punar Prathistha event of Lord Vyasa Raghupati followed by chaturmas vritha of H H Srimad Sudhindra Tirtha Swami.
